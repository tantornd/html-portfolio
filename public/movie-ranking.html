<h1>Best Movies Ever Created</h1>
<h2>The objectively correct list of best movies of all time because it's rated by me</h2>

<h3>The Last 10 Years</h3>
<p>Actually just a tearjerker since the first 5 minutes of the movie. RADWIMPS, the band
   that made the music for this show, really encapsulated the feeling of the fleeting passage
   of time.

<h3>April Come She Will</h3>
<p>
   This movie represents the nature of humans as we grow apart and take different paths in life.
   A university couple, who one day might have had dreams of spending their life together slowly lose feelings
   for each other, as the inevitable hands of time pry them apart.
</p>
<h3>Look Back</h3>
<p>
   Created by the author of Chainsaw Man, Look Back is a short movie that focuses on two mismatched pair of friends
   who both have the same goal ini mind. To one day become a manga artist. The two grow apart
   as one of them went off to univeristy to pursue learning background art. This movie is very thought compelling
   and will leave you with a new outlook on life. Never take anything for granted.
